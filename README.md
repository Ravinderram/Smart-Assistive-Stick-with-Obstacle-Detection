# Smart-Assistive-Stick-with-Obstacle-Detection
This project features a Smart Assistive Stick designed to aid visually impaired individuals. It uses an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection, a DFPlayer Mini module for audio feedback, and a servo motor for mechanical actions. The system alerts users about nearby obstacles through sound notifications, enhancing mobility and safety.
